Capistrano::Rsync for Capistrano v3
===================================
[![Gem version][gem-badge]](http://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-rsync)
[gem-badge]: https://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-rsync.png

**Deploy with Rsync** to your server from any local (or remote) repository when
using [**Capistrano**](http://www.capistranorb.com/).  Saves you from having to
install Git on your production machine and allows you to customize which files
you want to deploy. Also allows you to easily precompile things on your local
machine before deploying.

### Tour
- Works with the new [**Capistrano v3**](http://www.capistranorb.com/) ([source
  code](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)) versions `>= 3.0.0pre14` and
  `< 4`.
- Suitable for deploying any apps, be it Ruby, Rails, Node.js or others.  
- Exclude files from being deployed with Rsync's `--exclude` options.
- Precompile files or assets easily before deploying, like JavaScript or CSS.
- Caches your previously deployed code to speed up deployments ~1337%.
- Currently works only with Git (as does Capistrano v3), so please shout out
  your interest in other SCMs.

Using [Mina](http://nadarei.co/mina/) instead of Capistrano? I've built
[Mina::Rsync](https://github.com/moll/mina-rsync) as well.


Using
-----
Install with:
```
gem install capistrano-rsync
```

Require it at the top of your `Capfile` (or `config/deploy.rb`):
```ruby
require "capistrano/rsync"
```

Set some `rsync_options` to your liking:
```ruby
set :rsync_options, %w[--recursive --delete --delete-excluded --exclude=.git*]
```

Ensure to set `scm` to :rsync in your deploy.rb:
```ruby
set :scm, :rsync
```

And after setting regular Capistrano options, deploy as usual!
```
cap deploy
```

### Implementation
1. Clones and updates your repository to `rsync_stage` (defaults to
   `tmp/deploy`) on your local machine.
2. Checks out the branch set in the `branch` variable (defaults to `master`).
3. If `rsync_cache` set (defaults to `shared/deploy`), rsyncs to that directory
   on the server.
4. If `rsync_cache` set, copies the content of that directory to a new release
   directory.
5. If `rsync_cache` is `nil`, rsyncs straight to a new release directory.

After that, Capistrano takes over and runs its usual tasks and symlinking.

### Exclude files from being deployed
If you don't want to deploy everything you've committed to your repository, pass
some `--exclude` options to Rsync (note the equals signs):
```ruby
set :rsync_options, %w[
  --recursive --delete --delete-excluded
  --exclude=.git*
  --exclude=/config/database.yml
  --exclude=/test/***
  --include=/etc/folder
  --exclude=/etc/*
]
```

The `=` is required in order for patterns to be properly read. Note the order of the 
`--include` and `--exclude` params; if you wish to exclude an entire directory except
a certain folder, because of an Rsync quirk you must specify the include first.


### Precompile assets before deploy
Capistrano::Rsync runs `rsync:stage` before rsyncing. Hook to that like this:
```ruby
task :precompile do
  Dir.chdir fetch(:rsync_stage) do
    system "rake", "assets:precompile"
  end
end

after "rsync:stage", "precompile"
```

### Deploy release without symlinking the current directory
```
cap rsync:release
```


Configuration
-------------
Set Capistrano variables with `set name, value`.

Name          | Default | Description
--------------|---------|------------
repo_url      | `.` | The path or URL to a Git repository to clone from.  
branch        | `master` | The Git branch to checkout.  
rsync_stage   | `tmp/deploy` | Path where to clone your repository for staging, checkouting and rsyncing. Can be both relative or absolute.
rsync_cache   | `shared/deploy` | Path where to cache your repository on the server to avoid rsyncing from scratch each time. Can be both relative or absolute.<br> Set to `nil` if you want to disable the cache.
rsync_options | `[]` | Array of options to pass to `rsync`.
